Keep it Simple Slides
=====================

Slides decks, as markdown, backed by github gists.

User story
----------

- New slide deck: /anonymous/5850901
- Edit, preview, show.
- Save...
  - Login with github
  - Create gist

Find gist url, paste in, create slideshow.

Dealing with edits?
1. Log in to edit... only user can edit. No multiplayer editing, without consent.
2. Edit an anonymous fork.

Seems like version 1 makes most sense.

How gist works
--------------

Gists created by /anonymous are just that... anonymously created gists, anonymous is a special case user with no index page.
They remain forkable if you want to associate it with your user.
